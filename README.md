## Project Motivation

I completed this project as a requirement for the completion of my NanoDegree Program by Udacity.

## Project Overview

In this project I have used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN's) for detection of dog breeds. </br>
The model performs well and is able to detect the difference between Dog and Human Images.

## Libraries Used

1. keras </br>
2. numpy </br>
3. sklear </br>
4. glob </br>
5. random </br>
6. cv2 </br>
7. matplotlib </br>
8, tqdm

## Results

The model performs well achieving almost 79% accuracy.</br>
The program correctly distnguishes between humans and dog but seems to be slightly inaccrurate in the breed classification like mentioned earlier. According to my interpretation The output could be better:</br>
Ensemble of models</br>
If more breeds are added the accuracy could improve </br>
Fine tune the model to give better accuracy</br>
